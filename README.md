# CS50X_arrays
Here you can find how I solved the three problems that you can find in the second week of CS50X.

1) **Scrabble**
   Every letter on a word has a predetermined value, declared at the beginning of the code.
   Two players have to insert a word once the program has started, and who is going to have the higher amount of points will win.
   
3) **Readability**
   It assignes a mark to a text, that gives a date about the complexity of it; it uses this formula:
   
   *index = 0.0588 \* L - 0.296 \* S - 15.8*
   
   *L* is the average number of letters per 100 words in the text;
   *S* is the average number of sentences per 100 words in the text.
   
4) **Substitution**
   It is a program that *encrypts a phrase* using a *26 different letters key* that you have to declare on your terminal.
   
   In the source code I also included the function for the decryptation of the program.
